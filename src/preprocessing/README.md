You can run the entire preprocessing pipeline by executing the `derivative_pipeline.py` script. This script will run the following steps:

<!-- DERIVATIVE_STEPS_AUTOGENERATE_START -->

## 001_alignment
Merge individual EEG recordings of ceremony 1, sub-03 into a single file, aligned to the EEG from sub-01.

<!-- DERIVATIVE_STEPS_AUTOGENERATE_END -->
